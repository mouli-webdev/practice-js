//Array destructuring is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to variables in a more concise and readable way.
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const [a, c] = numbers;

console.log(a); // Output: 1
console.log(c); // Output: 3
